# What does layer mean

why do we use so many layers ,  
what is the intution behind layers?  

we can understand this with example of simple CNN face recognition model...   
    
    So its first layer can be for detecting edges AND curves of faces,,,
    
    second layer could be for detecting parts of face like nose,eyes,ears etc....

    and a third layer could be to recognise the entire face consisting all the previous features...

so each layer contributes for recognising something   ..
