# New Idea


## Idea
given a sentence  
find the objects in it  
ex - The toaster stopped working on saturday.   
objects - toaster

Now we need to find its superclass, in the knowledge base...   
and ask questions based on the attributes of that class..   



## result
maybe give a table to fill up or store the conversation.  
the table will contain all the attributes/features ..  

## HOW
This will be done using NER tags , if it does not work we'll ask the person to tell us the category using multiple options.


## Extensions
combine both rule based question generation and this approach to ask questions.  
ask questions from the rule based method first , if the user says its invalid use this knowledge_base_question_generation_from_attributes approach to answer.
