# The last idea wasen't feasible

So i was checking is the idea i thought yesterday could actually be done or not and in the end i concluded that it's not.

for the last part to convert actual sentence into question i need to have a model which can do that,    
fortunately one colleague had code for a attention model which we'll use.  
for now i'll refine the (question_word + verb + noun + other approproiate sent generation)   
Let's see how it works!
