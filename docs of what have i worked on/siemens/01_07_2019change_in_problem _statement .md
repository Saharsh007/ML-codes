# change in problem statement 

so today again i had a small change in the problem statement   
Srinidhi wants me to 
take a few articlles about a specific topic and extract all possible feeatures about it   
next step is to look for new articles of same topic and extract their features and then find out which all fetures are missing   
use the bigger set of features to ask queestions and fill in the article with all sset of features.
