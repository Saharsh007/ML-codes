# Relevancy Checker Failed


the other model didn't perform well , gonna train it again with validation split , lets see about that.


# Next thing

New idea   
We'll use knowledge base to ask questions , making it domain specific for now.
So if we are talking about mountains , and i know about mount everest then i'll answer about K2 using attributes from mount everest.   

1. Find out that K2 is subclass of class mount everest.

2. find attributes and directly use them to ask questions....
